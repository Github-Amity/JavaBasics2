Java conditions and loops

## What to know
Before you begin this project, you need to be familiar with Java if statements and for and while loops.
  
If you are not familiar with this already, watch the following tutorial within the given time frame:  
- [**Control Flow**](https://youtu.be/eIrMbAQSU34?t=5923) [1:38:43] to [End of **For-Each Loop**](https://youtu.be/eIrMbAQSU34?t=8518) [2:21:58]  
  
It is highly recommended to type and run the code along with the video on any IDE or using an online compiler such as [online-java.com](https://www.online-java.com/online_java_compiler).
